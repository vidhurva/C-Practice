A few programming answers to C++ interview questions

Hello! In this respository, I am sharing my solutions to a few C++ questions that have been used in coding interviews.

// QUESTIONS
1) You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. Write a C++ recursive function to determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

2) Binary Search: Write a C++ function to find the first index of this number in O(log n) time complexity using recursion.

3) Write a C++ function to recover a rotated array to the original sorted array.

4) Given an array nums of integers and an int k, partition the array (i.e. move the elements in “nums”) such that:
• All elements < k are moved to the left
• All elements >= k are moved to the right
Return the partitioning index, i.e. the first index i where nums[i] >= k.

5) Given an unsorted array with integers, find the median of it using the Quick Select method.
